# Automaty

Automaty is a React project built with Vite and TypeScript, designed to help QA Automation professionals practice their End-to-End testing skills using tools like Selenium and Cypress.

## Getting started

This app is publicly available at [automaty.vercel.app](https://automaty.vercel.app). But if you want to run it locally, follow these steps:

1. Install the dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

2. Run the development server
   
```bash
npm run dev
```

3. Start automating!

> [!NOTE]
> If you want to "login", use "admin" as your `username` and `password`. It's currently hardcoded with a fake delay between 1-5 randomly so you can practice waiting for an element to appear on the next route.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! If you'd like to contribute to Automaty, please fork the repository and submit a pull request.
